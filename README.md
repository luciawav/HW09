# Basic idea
Because I love music, I was thinking of doing something music-related this time.
I've looked at p5js's libraries and I'm choosing which one to use to display my visual image of the music. I initially chose polar because I really like the images that polar displays. So I found some more examples online

So I chose my favorite music, and I learned that linking such infinitely overlapping graphs to analyzing audio requires POLAR algorithms. So I started to understand this part

As I traced inside sketch, I wanted to link the idea from last time, but I put play music inside drawPolarShape to change it to this idea
But there are eleven people in this band, and I switched the idea to eleven sided shapes nested within each other

I used this line of thinking to make something similar to a music player I saw in my early years, and I'm happy that thanks to my coding I actually produced what I saw as a kid. This was my original idea, my other ideas are in my hand drawn sketch, but I only used one idea when I wrote the code

# Final
I think the hardest part is how to combine graphics and music. Although I did try last time, this time I learned about p5 fft to analyze waveforms. And the hardest part was how to draw nested graphs. Because it's actually not that hard to write the way to relate music and graphs, but I tried a lot of ways until I came up with 
map（）. I think the hardest part is how to combine graphics and music.
